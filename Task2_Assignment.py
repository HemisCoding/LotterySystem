# A user enters a lottery by visiting a website or using a mobile app. They are prompted to create an account or log in if they already have one.
# Once logged in, they can select the lottery they want to enter and choose their numbers or opt for a random selection.
# They then proceed to purchase their tickets using a payment method of their choice.

# If the user wins the lottery, they will receive a notification, either via email or through the app.
# They can then log in to their account and claim their winnings. If the winnings are below a certain amount,
# they can choose to have the money credited to their account or receive it as a check.
# If the winnings are above the limit, they may have to go to a claim center in person to receive the prize.
