#One method of implementing a lottery picking system is through a random number generator algorithm.\
# This can be done using the following steps:

# 1. Set up a database to store the list of participants with their unique identification numbers.

# 2. Assign a range of numbers to each participant, where the range is proportional to the number of
# tickets they have purchased. For example, if participant A has purchased 5 tickets, their assigned range could be 1-5.

# 3. Generate a random number within the total range of all participants.

# 4. Match the generated number with the assigned range of a participant to determine the winner.

# Pseudo-code for this algorithm in Python could look like this:

import random

def pick_winner(participants):
    total_range = sum(participant['tickets'] for participant in participants)
    winning_num = random.randint(1, total_range)
    lower_bound = 0
    for participant in participants:
        upper_bound = lower_bound + participant['tickets']
        if lower_bound < winning_num <= upper_bound:
            return participant['id']
        lower_bound = upper_bound

participants = [{'id': 1, 'tickets': 5},
                {'id': 2, 'tickets': 3},
                {'id': 3, 'tickets': 2}]
winner = pick_winner(participants)
print(f"The winner is participant with id {winner}")

# For the API design, a simple RESTful API can be created to allow participants to enter the lottery and retrieve the results.
# The API can have the following endpoints:

# POST "/participants" to add a new participant to the database with their number of tickets.

# GET "/winners" to retrieve the list of winners.

# A simple database model could be a table named "participants" with columns for "id", "tickets", and "winner"
# (a boolean column to indicate if the participant has won or not).
